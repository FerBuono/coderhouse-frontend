#### Project Overview

The project has the book database stored at Cloud Firestore. On the website, you can find books by category, author, series, or using the search bar. You can also save them in the wishlist for a future purchase. The cart is functional, and you can see the fully detailed purchases you've made in My Orders. The user registration system, though lacking validation, allows you to add items to your wishlist and cart.

#### Project Overview

My very first project, created for the Web Developer course of the CoderHouse's Full Stack Dev career. The web is fully responsive. The pages were created with HTML, SASS was used for styling, and a minor JavaScript code was implemented to give dynamism to the header. Bootstrap was also used, particularly for the main page carousel.
