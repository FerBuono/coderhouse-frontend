## Project overview

The project has the book database stored at Cloud Firestore. On the website, you may find them by category, author, series, or using the search bar. You are also able to save them in the wishlist for a future purchase. The cart is functional and you can see the fully detailed purchases you've made in My Orders, whoses states will always remain as "Processing...". It also includes a user registration system, which for the moment doesn't have any kind of validation, but allows you to add items to your wishlist and to the cart.
